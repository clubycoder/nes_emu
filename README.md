# Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator

This is just a passion project for me to create an NES emulator using C++ and SDL2.  This was sparked by [David Barr / One Lone Coder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA)'s playlist for [Creating an NES emulator from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrOv9FMX8xJHqMvSGB_9G9nZZ_4IgteYf).  His implementation is [here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES).
